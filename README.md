# Nonogram Solver

This is the class project of [CMPT 463 Advanced Algorithms](https://catalogue.usask.ca/CMPT-463) at USask.
The project is inspired by Batenburg and Kosters' paper: _Solving Nonograms by
combining relaxations_. The program is able to solve a colored Nonogram puzzle
by using dynamic programming techniques in a relatively fast speed. 

Puzzles are web-crawled from [nonograms.org](https://www.nonograms.org/) and 
solved by Python 3. Then it is able to display the solving progress in
[Processing](https://processing.org/) Python mode.
